# _fusion.ssg_

## Purpose

A tool that greatly simplifies the process of creating static websites.

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of the __fusing__ together of various elements (HTML, Markdown, TypseScript components, JSON data, YAML front matter, etc.).

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript`. No excuses, _it just works beautifully_.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and nothing else. It will not provide any other tooling other than what is absolutely necessary to accomplish that. This keeps the scope of the project focused, preventing feature creep, and benefits users who will be able to pick and chose their own tools.

## Current Status

The project is still in its prerelease stage. One or more _Beta releases_ will follow and should be considered _unstable_ and _transient_. While in Beta, features and implementations might change dramatically and this should be considered the norm.

### What Has Been Implemented

- [x] Support for _simple HTML document creation_ using _Pages, Templates and Includes_.

- [x] Support for _simple token replacement_ involving _front matter property values_ and _matching property names_ in HTML.

- [x] Support for Typescript _`.tsx` components_, _compilation_ and _sand-boxed execution_.

- [x]  Support for _document hydration_ using Typescript components and JSON data sources.

- [x] Support for generating _collections of pages_ using Typescript components and JSON data sources.

- [x] Support for base URLs.

- [x]  Support for content posting (e.g. Blogging)

  - [x] Support for tags.

  - [x] Support for categories.

### What Remains To Be Done

- Work in progress pages.

- End-User project generation.

- Project website and documentation.

- Encourage early community involvement.

- Provide sufficient testing to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions.

- User project generation preconfigured for TypeScript and Preact's render-to-string.

### Longer Term Goals

- Seek RFC.

- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major Alpha release.
