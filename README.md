HTML, Markdown, Front Matter + Custom `.tsx and .jsx` Components.

## Installation

Full installation instructions can be found at [fusionssg.com](https://fusionssg.com/docs/installation/).

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of **_fusing_** together various elements (HTML, Markdown, Components, JSON data, YAML front matter, etc.).

## Features

- No initial project configuration is required.
- DOMless and serverless results in very quick build times.
- HTML document composition from markdown, HTML, tokens, .jsx and .tsx components, JSON data sources and meta data.
- .tsx and .jsx sand-boxed exaction.
- .ts browser scripts.
- Portfolio (multiple pages) generation via collections.
- Generated projects provide package.json scripts for development and release builds.
- CLI for one-off development and one-off release builds.
- Base URL support for sites hosted in sub folders.
- Works in progress for HTML documents that should be ignored during release builds.
- Blogging support, including multiple categories and tags.
- Optional cache busting during release builds for your project's assets<span style="color: yellow;"><small> v1.2.0</small></span>.
- Conditional composition of includes based on build strategy<span style="color: yellow;"><small> v1.2.0</small></span>.
- The reporting of works in progress during release builds<span style="color: yellow;"><small> v1.2.0</small></span>.
- Additional post metadata exposed as simple tokens<span style="color: yellow;"><small> v1.2.0</small></span>.
- Beautified HTML documents.

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` (no excuses, _it just works beautifully_) and runs on `Node`.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and websites and requires no knowledge of other front-end frameworks. This keeps the scope of the project focused and preventing feature creep.

## Versioning
Current version: v1.2.0. We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
