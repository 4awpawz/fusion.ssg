# Minimal SSG Framework For Building Static Websites

HTML, Markdown, Front Matter + Custom `.tsx and .jsx` Components.

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of **_fusing_** together various elements (HTML, Markdown, Components, JSON data, YAML front matter, etc.).

## Features

- Simple HTML document creation using Pages, Templates and Includes.
- Simple token replacement involving front matter property values and matching property names in HTML.
- .tsx and .jsx component compilation and sand-boxed execution.
- Document hydration using components and JSON data sources.
- Page collections using components and JSON data sources.
- Base URLs.
- Development and release builds.
- Content posting (e.g. Blogging).
  - Tags.
  - Categories.
- Works in progress.
  - Individual files.
  - Folders.
  - Ignored.
- End user project creation.

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` (no excuses, _it just works beautifully_) and runs on `Node`.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and nothing else. It will not provide any other tooling other than what is absolutely necessary to accomplish that. Importantly, fusion.ssg requires no knowledge of front-end frameworks like React. This keeps the scope of the project focused, preventing feature creep, and benefits users who will be able to pick and chose their own tools.

## Current Status And Semantic Versioning

The project is still under v1.0.0-beta development. When all features targeted for v1.0.0 are implemented in beta and are stable, the version number will be bumped to remove the beta sub status. Going forward, odd version numbers are to be considered development release builds and even numbered version numbers are to be considered production release builds.

### What Has Already Been Implemented

- [X] Support for _simple HTML document creation_ using _Pages, Templates and Includes_.
- [X] Support for _simple token replacement_ involving _front matter property values_ and _matching property names_ in HTML.
- [X] Support for _`.tsx` and .jsx components_, _compilation_ and _sand-boxed execution_.
- [X]  Support for _document hydration_ using components and JSON data sources.
- [X] Support for generating _collections of pages_ using components and JSON data sources.
- [X] Support for base URLs.
- [X] Support for development and release builds.
- [X]  Support for content posting (e.g. Blogging).
  - [X] Support for tags.
  - [X] Support for categories.
- [X] Work in progress templates.
  - [X] Individual files.
  - [X] Folders.
  - [X] Ignored.
- [X] End user project creation.

### What Still Remains To Be Done

- Logo, fusion.ssg is desperately in need of a great logo.
- Project documentation website - _currently under development_.
- Encourage early community involvement and adoption.
- Provide sufficient testing to reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions.

### Longer Term Goals

- Seek RFC.
- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major Alpha release.
