# Minimal Framework For Building Static Websites

HTML, Markdown, Front Matter + Custom `.tsx and .jsx` Components.

## Installation

Full installation instructions can be found at [fusionssg.com](https://fusionssg.com/docs/installation/).

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of **_fusing_** together various elements (HTML, Markdown, Components, JSON data, YAML front matter, etc.).

## Features

- No initial project configuration is required.
- Effortless project creation using fusion.ssg's project generator.
- DOMless and serverless execution produces very quick build times.
- HTML document composition from markdown, HTML, tokens, .jsx and .tsx components, JSON data sources and meta data.
- .tsx and .jsx compilation and sand-boxed execution.
- .ts browser script compilations.
- Portfolio (multiple pages) generation via collections.
- Generated projects provide package.json scripts for development and release builds.
- CLI for one-off development and one-off release builds.
- Base URL support for sites hosted in sub folders.
- HTML documents that are works in progress can be ignored during release builds.
- Blogging support, including multiple categories and tags.
- Optional cache busting of website assets during release builds (v1.2.0).
- Conditional composition of includes based on build strategy (v1.2.0).
- Reporting of works in progress during release builds (v1.2.0).
- Blog metadata exposed as simple tokens (v1.2.0).
- Beautified HTML documents.

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` (no excuses, _it just works beautifully_) and runs on `Node`.

## Project Scope

The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and websites and requires no knowledge of other front-end frameworks. This keeps the scope of the project focused and prevents feature creep.

## Versioning

Current version: v1.2.0. We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
