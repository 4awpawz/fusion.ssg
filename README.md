# The web framework for creating static content-driven websites

fusion.ssg seamlessly fuses together familiar web-based technologies (*__i.e. HTML, Markdown, Front Matter, and Custom .tsx and .jsx Components.__*) to propel your static website development to a whole new level.

## Current Stable Version

## Create resilient static websites

- Philosophy - The most useful tools are those that fully embrace the functionality that directly reflects their purpose and ignores all others.
- Minimalistic - fusion.ssg is built from the ground up to be just that, making it quick to learn for anyone who already has experience with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
- Productivity - No complicated tooling and configuration to stand in the way of your creativity, and the project generator gets you up and creating quickly.
- Fast - Capable of generating hundreds of pages in under a second.

- Component compilation and sand-boxed execution.

## Installation

Full installation instructions can be found at [fusionssg.com](https://fusionssg.com/docs/v1/gettingstarted/installation/).

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` (no excuses, _it just works beautifully_) and runs on `Node`.

## Project Scope

The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and websites and requires no knowledge of other front-end frameworks. This keeps the scope of the project focused and prevents feature creep.

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
